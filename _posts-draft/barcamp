## Educational Instition Liberalization


In today's world, we are either getting caught more in the hands of megacorporations or moving more towards freedom. But the core our efforts come the place we get educated at. During my college days, I was tought to write code in .NET, where we are told to drag and drop elements, and write only the functionality for an event. But to I was a curious person to see how a drag and drop worked. I was curious to know, why cant I uninstall Internet Explorer while I could uninstall any other software. At certain point, I just realized we were all digital slaves. We are want the software wants to us to be.

Free Software is obviously the way to go, but what about the core educational instituion which act as a way of people learning and getting educated ? Should they also be free(dom) ? Well GNU/Linux provides all those, but we are resistent. Even with the govt asking us to move towards the open world, we are resistant. What is stopping these educational institutions to move towards Free Software ? What are we resisting ? Is not knowing to do something what is restricting us ? or we moving out of our traditional ways that is stopping us. Even more, 	are the unknows too many ?? Firewall, monitoring, control, software updates and breakages is what is stopping the institution system administrators from suggessting it to the management ? Yes, to the management it is also a huge cost cut off factor, but most of them pirate. Is that legal. Is the institutions setting the right example for the budding young people of our country ??

Well if all these question are on you, you have found the right set of people. We are set of hackers, woking on solving some of these issues technically and some philosophically. We still have a lot of unknowns, and a lot of interesting problems to work with. 
Come along discuss with us, hack with us, and lets make educational institutions in India free . . . ! After all 

## Educational Institutions should teach their students to be citizens of a strong, capable, independent and free society.
