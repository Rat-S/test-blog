<p class="meta">8 August 2016 -  It does matter whether you are **Black** or **White**. </p>


The reason for my virginity is not be the stringent morale that I live by. 
It is the stupid inferiority complex that I had from my childhood regarding my looks. 
My mom continously reminded me that I am black. (Do not confuse it with the people of African origin. It is this stupid shit in south India where people are generally brown, but the skin texture sometime appears black or sometime light brown. I am black. I mean my skin is darker than many African Americans I have seen. I am very much black than the POTUS Obama. That guy is very pale for a black person in India.) This shit is so much into their minds that when a child is born, the kins who are enquiring about it pop "Is the baby black or white?" as the first question. That shit is unbelievable. My folks consider having fair skin as visually appealing and I do not blame that. But they also think that having a dark skin is something to be ashamed of. 
And it is also that my mom hate my nose. When she was a kid she must have been so worried that she had disproportianately large nose as I have heard her complain about my nose atleast a hundred times. According to her, I inherited worst of both my parents. My dad's lineage has a huge forehead which is considered as quite un appealing. Many in their family has numerous lipomas all over their body. I have about 50 lipomas in my body and few of them aslmost in the size of a squash ball. They are quire short tempered. My mom is not quite a happy person. I have read somewhere that happiness is inherited and I believe I inherited it from her. And as you already know, I have black skin and ugly nose inherited from her. 
When one hear from one's mom that one is ugly, one doesn't have a mindset to hit on girls. 
I do not remember having casual conversation with a girl until I was 17. 
My perception has changed a lot since then. If I wasn't in that mindset, I might have lost my virginity long back, but now it is a different reason that is holding me back. Once you are virgin till 25, you do not just want to lose it to some stranger you picked up at a bar. So yeah, I am waiting for special someone. How silly. LMAO.
