This is not really a blog where I will write something up interesting for the world to read. I intend to copy stuffs form somewhere else and just post it here. I won't be posting the copyrighted content owned by others, and even if I do, I will try my best to keep it within the scope of fair use. Being legal is very important, isn't it. 
**Who am I kidding?** I think that legality is absolute bullshit. Legality in most cases just reflects the legislators mindset. For instance, in where I live, pornography is illegal, but prostitution is not. I 've heard that a legislation bans oral sex in a South Asian nation (*But they provide an exception if it is used for foreplay* ).  There are laws against same sex marriage, and even sex with a partner of same sex. Though the scene is slowly changing, can you justify the suffering of people who fall victim of these laws? One act is legal somewhere at some time, but when the time and place changes, the legality of that action changes. It is very hard to keep up. 
So **fuck law**
