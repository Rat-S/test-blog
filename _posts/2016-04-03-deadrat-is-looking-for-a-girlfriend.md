I was under the impression that I am better alone. I have been told that if continue my lifestyle, no one will be attending my funeral. But that never bothered me; I mean why should it bother me as if it is my funeral, I would be dead by then. I have a boring and repetitive job that pays me enough to spend on food, drugs and few other things. Once I am done with that lengthy 9 hours at my workplace, I spend rest of my day either taking in some junk or watching porn and jerking myself off. It was all going smooth until recently. I think I might need a girlfriend (or a boyfried if I am a queer.) What the fuck? I thought that love was some shitty arrangement built around lies such as love, attachment, loyalty and trust. My mind is now so fucked up that I want some real human to share the emotions and my feelings. I have never had such crazy ideas and now I think I am losing my mind.

I don't remember most of the shit that happened for my first eight years. I have spent next 16 years without getting bulshitted by these craps such as love and friendship. But what the heck has happened now. I insisted a physician and had my head scanned for any tumors, but they couldn't detect one. I know that there are crazy netizens who get dopamine released if they answer stranger's queries and I am hoping to turn t them for help in figuring out the shit that I am going through.

I used to cry a lot and that helped me a lot to clear my head, but strangely I haven't been able to cry lately no matter how much I try. I just feel shitty and it seems like I can't live anymore.

Edit: someone emailed me a response to this post last week saying that I need to get a girlfriend. But how do I get one. I presume that if someone who has a friend who happens to be a girl and if they are interested, they can ask her out. But I have no friends. So I decided to go to places like bars and parks hoping that I might get a girlfriend there, but when they ask people there on a date, they either run away or call me a creep. And a few just laughed it off and walked away. So I turned to online dating sites and I could hardly find a woman there. So I tried dating apps meant for homosexual people, but those buggers either want to have a sex talk or else want to have sex. Though I am not paranoid about diseases I don't want to risk having STD by fucking a stranger. Moreover the idea of having intercourse with another man brings out the feeling of revulsion. So I have reached dead end. And I am republishing this post today looking for some more help. 

It seems like the only way left out is to be social, get some friends and then maybe someday meet someone who might agree to be my girlfried. But that is awfully long process and I think that the probability of success by this method might be only 0.5.

What do I do now? I don't know why, but I didn't even *abuse any substance* this weekend. I don't feel like doing it.
