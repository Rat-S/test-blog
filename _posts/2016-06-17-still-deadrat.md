<p class="meta">17 June 2016 -  I am still deadrat </p>

If you are a jobless creep, you might know why I decided to [play human](http://blog.deadrat.in/2016/04/03/deadrat-is-looking-for-a-girlfriend.html) last year. I have to admit that it had pretty good time during that cos play. Most credits go to this cute little devil at work. We became good friends! Unbelievable, right? How can someone be friends with a lunatic deadrat! Well, she was. I do not want to get into the details, but she made me feel the way I have never felt before. Although I made a very similar statement after I had a colonoscopy once, let me be very clear that these feelings were complete opposite of one another. But both made me feel, “That was my first and it will be the last.” ( Someone stole this phrase, slightly modified and call it as "*Matthew 20:16*" )

She needed a small favour and a mutual friend introduced her to me.  It was just the formal greeting in the beginning, but it was regular. Later it got a little flirtatious and then after a while we exchanged our numbers. Oh, did I mention that the medium of conversation until we exchanged numbers was the creepy instant messenger used in office. It could be monitored, but hey, I didn't give a fuck. Now **pause** reading for a moment and let that sentence sink in. I insist on E2EE for some pure nonsense that no one would care about, but to flirt, I used an instant messaging platform that stores the data in the server for the sole purpose of being monitored by my employer. Unfortunately, I wasn't fired from my job. So our story almost sounds like a Rom-Com movie and I take the liberty to assume that you would have watched a lot. So I am not going to bore you with more details (and also that I believe rom-com movies are shit and anyone who watches those movies are absolutely shit.) But unlike those movies, my story has a good ending.  

I live in a creepy country, where in some families parents decide mating partner for their offspring. So things got better. Luckily her parents started a search party to identify a *suitable groom*, whatever that means. Analysing the responses they got, my little devil realized see that she could **do** better than me. I acted swiftly and made her realize that she never had any feeling for me. So we let each other go off and finally I got a chance to get back to my nice favourite herbaceous plant. I missed those heavenly herbs for an year. But now that I am back on them, I feel so **Free**. 
Hang on a second. Now I realize that that this post might be ready by **up-scale, peace loving, yuppie looking, environmentally conscious ass-holes who got enlightened by a fucking *antelope with beard and mane*.** So let me be clear. I feel Free (as in freedom). 

If I look back, I can clearly see that I might have ended up as a happy man with lovely family. What a fucking nightmare that would have been! Luckily, That didn't happen. Father Time was on my side. *I am still **deadrat**.* 
**Amen**
