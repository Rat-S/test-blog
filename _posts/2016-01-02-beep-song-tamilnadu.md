I know that most of my posts doesn't make any sense, but in particular, **this post may not make much sense to you if you do not have any link to South India or if you don't give a shit about Tamil Films and songs.** 

I visited a village near Coimbatore to celebrate Pongal recently. I had set the so called [infamous "beep song"](http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/beep-song-raises-a-storm-of-protests/article7985908.ece) as my phone's ringtone and when it rang in the public places, I got the reactions that made me LMAO.
The song was little obscene, so I had kept it as my phone's ring tone, but when in rang it in the bus used for public transit, I got the reaction from the crowd that was so precious. I was very intrigued by it. So I set it as an alarm tone and made it ring at almost all places to see how the people react. Everybody, well almost, recognized the tune. When I tried it in a post office, a gentleman said, "தம்பி இது தப்பு பா, மாத்தீரு. (It is immoral, change it.)" I looked confused and when I asked what exactly he was talking about, he just gave me a look as if an apocalypse came and he walked away. 
When I tried in a bus stop, couple of people tried to stare me away. By their appearance, I can say that they were lecturers. I stared back at them. There was a college nearby and they must've mistaken me for a student, so they tried to *hegemonize* me. I so badly wanted to kick their arse, but that would've attracted unwanted attention which I like too much. *So I walked away*.  (I have a *thing* against these teachers/lecturers and doctors, but that is for another time.)
It was epic when the two policemen mumbled among themselves and giving me a strange stare.  I badly wanted them to arrest me. If they had, it would've been super cool. I wonder whether they can arrest me for for having the tune of a controversial song as ring tone? If they can, under what section would they book me? I'm pretty sure that Silambarasan T.R will not file a copyright lawsuit against me for possessing it and the Judge probably wouldn't accept it as a criminal copyright infringement. The ringtone wasn't really offensive as I had cropped the song and the file I had contained only the opening chords. It didn't have any lyrics in it. Nevertheless it offended people very well.
