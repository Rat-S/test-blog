It is election time! A lot of expectations and excitement is in the air and people are getting ready for the big day with hope. But unfortunately I see that a bunch of bastards are canvassing the people (mostly targeting stupid people) to select *None of the above* instead of their favourite candidate in the poll.
As per our constitution, every citizen have their right to vote for the candidate they like or abstain from doing so; but I am afraid that these half-boiled bastards are thinking with their dick (or probably under misconception) that NOTA is their best choice. [The Election Commission has already clarified](http://eci.nic.in/eci_main/press/current/pn051208.pdf) that the the voters who exercise the option of NOTA would only be deemed to have abstained themselves from voting and under the law, the candidate who secures highest number of valid votes polled, irrespective of his winning margin, is declared elected. If you are still not sure how it works, as [someone pointed out](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/4f6bl5/what_the_fuck_is_nota/d26cvf3), say a city has 100 citizens. Even if 99 of them voted NOTA, and the last 1 person voted for candidate A, then A gets elected to rule that city! 
There could still be reasons that you want to select **NOTA** and *abstain from voting*. If all the candidates nominated in poll are sons of bitches, select the one who is least bitchy.

For the sake of argument, let us imagine that there are three assholes contesting for the seat in your constituency where there are 100 voters enrolled. After the polls are concluded, let us assume that the sloppiest asshole got 30 votes, the next sloppier asshole 25 and the tightest one got 20 votes. Now about 15 intellects like you decided to go with *none of the above* and 10 bastards didn't show up to the election as they had **more** important stuff to do. The sloppiest asshole will get elected and you all being the intellects do not want that; do you?
So get your ass out there and select your preferred candidates. I know that you do not have any sweet pussy to select, but at least you can select the asshole that you like if you exercise your right properly.
And for fucks' sake don't argue that people won't elect the worst possible choice. They definitely do. In this system the dumbest lunatics' vote has same value as yours and they are the majority. 

There is no reason that you should listen to me. I am just another asshole like you. I hope that there is some mushy mushy grey shit inside that thick skull of yours. Use that and think. Then act.
