**It is always safe to wear a [condom](http://www.wikihow.com/Use-a-Condom).** 

The above sentence might be very irrelevant to the rest of the post; so is the financial advice given by bigots. Unfortunately the world is full of bigots; just the way how internet is full of shit - like this post. 


The shit I wanted to crap today is about how most *people* go advising that saving is a very good habit and how it could help someone's financial situation. (Edit: by [saving](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saving), I meant saving money. Not some shitty document that you were editing earlier.) The problem with that advise is that whoever takes this malarkey is someone who is already *fucked up financially*. And it goes without saying that these lunatic bastards are probably in deep shit known as debt. 

For someone in debt, I don't see how saving could make financial sense. AFAIK, lenders charge you a hell lot more interest than you could earn in most of the safe investments and savings scheme. At least that is how where I live. I guess that was the whole Idea behind the lovely old banking; rope in money and pay interest on it and then lend that money for higher rate of interest. 

Let us take the case of Kuppusamy, a *clodpole* from [Tamil Nadu](http://www.tamilnadutourism.org/). He has educational loan for ₹400000 which compounds at 13 % p.a., a personal loan for ₹350000 which compounds at 15 % p.a., and ₹150000 debt over his credit cards whose interest varies between 25 % and 41 % p.a. He earns ₹30000 p.m. Some asshole told him to save some money, so this knobhead was making a recurring deposit of ₹2000 that pays him the interest of 9 % and he has ₹20000 saved in his savings bank account that pays him 4 % p.a. What the fuck was he up to? 

I tried to get some sense into his thick skull but we were surrounded by few other clowns at that time who convinced that it is a really good habit to continue to save despite his difficulty. That could possibly a good habit to save, but definitely not when he is in such a mess. Why would you invest for 4 % p.a. when you are paying up to 40 % p.a. on the other side. Being a shitty at  convincing, all I could do was let my blood boil when those clowns praised this birdbrain.  


 
It is **not** always safe to wear a condom. It could be safe if you wear it for fucking a stranger.  It could also be safe to wear it when you fuck some whom you know and if they have STD. But I cannot see how protective it could be while peeing. Use apt measures, you bastards. You can use condom when driving a slut, but you have to wear helmet / seat-belt when driving a vehicle.
