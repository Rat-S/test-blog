##### Fuck You tree hugging bastards.


Hari Suku
As per religion, alcohol is served in heaven lost death, but cunning humans  taste it in the mortal earth. Responsible drinking is inevitable for the food ecosystem. So much grapes, rice,potatoes, sugarcane will go waste



Nothing goes waste. Whatever is in this universe stays in this universe. It may change its form, but you can't call it as going waste.

grapes, rice and potato had rotten / rots / and will rot in this earth and gets decomposed. It then could take another form as a tree or a mud or whateverthef the time and position makes it. 

It was in earth and it stays in earth. How is it a waste.

Same goes for animals (including homo sapiens) They took the earthly matter as nutrition and grew. They expelled the waste into this earth. They die and stay in earth. (or maybe in some nearby planets if they are astronaut or traveller).

I don't see anything getting wasted.



When I am hungry in a point on earth and at the same time, if a fruit rich in starch and nutrients are getting converted into compost, it is just a random act. Nothing goes waste.
Humans are earthly subjects like air and water. Flood erodes the path it takes. Similarly humans sometimes takes some uranium or hydrogen and make some changes to it that has a bit larger impact. I see no crime in that.

under which situation it goes compost.. decides weather it goes waste or not.. A Fruit box dumped in a corner of a Concret structure still decomposes.. What's the use of it



if the same was consumed by a human and then expelled as waste and gets decomposed. What difference does it make.



No the answer is not "human is not hungry now".


Human will decompose eventually.
